## Descriptions

Fill the [`descriptions.toml`](./description.toml) configuration with the class descriptions.
When running the CI this file will be merged with the classes to combine the descriptions.

The first class defined is a special class: `_DummyClass`. This will hold some descriptions commonly used in extracting the classes.
Another special class is `_ApplyToAll_DummyClass`.
All properties listed in this class will be applied to all classes that have that property. Specify that property on a class to overwrite the descriptions or set it to empty to remove it.

Descriptions can be defined for:

- `Variables`
- `Structures.{Structure name}`
- `Enums`

Example:

```toml
[MyClass.Variables]
PropertyName="Something interesting"
```

## Replication blocks

> **Warning** These replication statements may not be correct. Please check the official documentation or ask help in the Rocket League mapmaking discord server.

If a class has replicated variables, there will be a `replicated` block at the bottom of the class.

```c++
replicated
{
    if (statementCode) // The replication condition
        Location; // The variables that will be replicated when the condition is true
}
```

If a statement is not known, a comment will be placed behind the default statement.
