# Autogenerated dummy classes

Autogenerated [dummy classes](https://github.com/RocketLeagueMapMaking/RL-dummy-classes).

Current version: v2.26

To add:

- replication blocks
- resolve (most) warnings

Current warning count: 2409

## Descriptions

Fill the [`descriptions.toml`](./description.toml) configuration with the class descriptions.
When running the CI this file will be merged with the classes to combine the descriptions.

The first class defined is a special class: `_ApplyToAll_DummyClass`.
All properties listed in this class will be applied to all classes that have that property. Specify that property on a class to overwite the descriptions or set it to empty to remove it.

Descriptions are defined for:

- `Variables`
- `Structures.{Structure name}`
- `Enums`

Example:

```toml
[MyClass.Variables]
PropertyName="Something interesting"
```
